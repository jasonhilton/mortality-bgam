# mortality-bgam

This repo is a signpost to redirect users to the repo jasonhilton/mortality_bgam. The JRSS paper has a typo in the link to github, kindly pointed out by a conscientious user, so that the underscore in the repo name was replaced with a hyphen.

The correct link to the code need to reproduce the results in the paper "Projecting UK Mortality using Bayesian Generalised Additive Models" is [https://github.com/jasonhilton/mortality_bgam](https://github.com/jasonhilton/mortality_bgam).
